In this lab, I worked with a color image and converted it from BGR format to RGB format. I then applied several arithmetic operations to study their effects on image brightness and contrast.

### Implemented Tasks
The following tasks were implemented in Python:

- Load and display the original image  
- Increase brightness using the `cv2.add` function  
- Decrease brightness using `cv2.subtract`  
- Increase contrast using `cv2.multiply`  
- Decrease intensity using `cv2.divide`  

### Visualization
To enhance visualization and make comparison easier, all processed images were displayed in a single figure using Matplotlib’s `subplot` functionality. The figure size and layout were adjusted to improve clarity and readability.

### Learning Outcomes
Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience with image intensity transformations, understood how arithmetic operations affect image brightness and contrast, and learned how to efficiently visualize multiple image outputs side by side.
